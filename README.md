# CAFE01-final-project
My final project for CodeAcademy front-end curriculum.

What i used:  <br>
React for front-end interfaces. <br>
SqLite3 for storing data. <br>
Axios to make front-end api requests a little bit easier. <br>
Express to handle requests for database. <br>
Concurrently to start database and react-app at the same time. <br>
Styled-Components to style those components, that i used in multiple files. <br>
React-Router to implement multiple 'pages' in react. <br>
React-spinners to make a good looking loading animation. <br>
Bootstrap for additional components. <br>
Crypto-JS to encrypt given passwords. <br>
Nodemon to make programming easier, so you dont have to manually update server after every change. <br>
