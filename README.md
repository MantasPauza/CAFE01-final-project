# CAFE01-final-project
My final project for CodeAcademy front-end curriculum.

What i used: 
React for front-end interfaces.
SqLite3 for storing data.
Axios to make front-end api requests a little bit easier.
Express to handle requests for database.
Concurrently to start database and react-app at the same time.
Styled-Components to style those components, that i used in multiple files.
React-Router to implement multiple 'pages' in react.
React-spinners to make a good looking loading animation.
Bootstrap for additional components.
Crypto-JS to encrypt given passwords.
Nodemon to make programming easier, so you dont have to manually update server after every change.
